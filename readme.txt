A silly plugin doing silly and useless stuff. Try it, it's great fun! This unique plugin is a must to at least try for a few days!

== Description ==

That's right... There are over 2000 plugins registered at wordpress.org repositories. And all of them have a purpose. Do something useful or are otherwise not-worthless.

This plugin is different and therefor unique from all of them; It is not useful to use this plugin. It doesn't do anything interesting (which is kinda interesting in itself) and does not enrich your site with new features or functions.

So what does it do? Upon activation it sets the goal at a default of 300 and generates a random number out of that. Then it starts counting... When it reaches the random set number, something happens (non-violent or destructive, honestly. It's all about the fun!) and the random number is reset to another random value and starts counting again... FRIGGEN USELESS!! yay! Amazing isn't it?
