A silly plugin doing nothing. Try it, it's great fun! This unique plugin is a must to at least try for a few days!

== Description ==

That's right... There are thousands of plugins registered at wordpress.org repositories. And all of them have a purpose. Do something useful or are otherwise not-worthless.

This plugin is different and therefor unique from all of them; It is not useful to use this plugin. It doesn't do anything interesting (which is kinda interesting in itself) and does not enrich your site with new features or functions.

So what does it do? Nothing! FRIGGEN USELESS!! yay! Amazing isn't it?
